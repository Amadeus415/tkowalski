  <h1><u><a name="fce" class="header">Functional Capacity Evaluations</a></u></h1><br>
  <em>8 Hour FCE (Functional Capacity Evaluation)</em>
	<ul><li>The 8 hour FCE may be completed over the course of two 4 hour time slots or one full 8 hour day.</li> 
	<li>Rationale for the 8 hour FCE is the treating physician’s, adjustor’s or case manager’s questioning the reliability of effort on the part of the injured worker in terms of RTW, RTW at full capacity, RTW with restrictions, RTW with modifications or a potential Permanent and Stationary status.</li>
	<li>Issues of consistency, reliability, pain magnification, pain migration, sub-maximum effort and other aspects will be reviewed and compared.</li></ul><br>


<em>6 hour FCE:</em>
	<ul><li>The 6 hour FCE is essentially a condensed 8 hour evaluation. The parameters would be essentially the same in terms of the issues of reliability of effort.</li>
	<li>The rationale for a 6 hour FCE versus 8 hour would be a position that is more sedentary versus moderate to heavy per position guidelines.(examples would include an office worker versus a construction worker, a computer operator versus a Muni driver, an administrative assistant versus a police officer or fire fighter.)</li>
	<li>A 6 hour FCE would also be used for a re-check of an FCE, RTW per new position requirements, and a RTW for a position transfer within a comparable department and other position modifications.</li></ul><br>


<em>4 hour FCE:</em>
	<ul><li>The 4 hour FCE is a one day evaluation that is designed for specific RTW issues, return to therapy issues, return to therapy for work hardening and other matters.</li>
	<li>As the reliability of effort issue(s) are resolved; this abbreviated FCE for 4 hours is designed to review specific issues of lift, carry, push, pull and other position related activities.</li>
	<li>The assumption is that this client is presenting a consistent and reliable picture of performance and parameters are required for momentum of the injured worker’s case, a return to work, accommodations and related issues.</li></ul><br>

<em>2 hour FCE:</em>
<ul><li>This is a pre-employment FCE to review the individual’s ability to perform up to the position requirements of the respective position.</li>
<li>The individual would not have an employment related injury related to the upcoming position offer within the firm/company.</li></ul><br>

<em>On-site FCE:</em>
<ul><li>In selected situations, the FCE can be completed at the individuals work location per the demands of the position and related issues.</li>
<li>With the On-Site FCE, a minimum time of 4 hours is suggested.</li></ul><br>

<em>Brief Return-to-Work Evaluations:</em>
<ul><li> Given accepted mutual desire for a rapid RTW, a brief 90 minute RTW eval can be completed with a Same Day Report.</li>
<li>This evaluation along with report can be coordinated to job specifics for return to work status.</li></ul><br>

A current position description is always useful for the FCE.
If one is not available, a Job Analysis should be completed prior to the FCE.
